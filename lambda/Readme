AWS Lambda

1. With AWS Lambda, you can run code without provisioning or managing servers. 
You pay only for the compute time that you consume—there's no charge when your code isn't running.

2. The Lambda function handler is the method in your function code that processes events. 
When your function is invoked, Lambda runs the handler method. Your function runs until the handler returns a response, exits, or times out.

3. You can use the following general syntax when creating a function handler in Python:


 def handler_name(event, context): 
    ...
    return some_value    


4. Key Take Aways.

	•	All Lambda functions must have a Handler function
	•	Handler functions must accept 2 (and only 2) arguments:
	•	event: The data from the event that triggered the function
	•	context: The data about the execution environment of the function
